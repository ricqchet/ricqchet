Rebase the current branch on `origin/main` and resolve any conflicts.

> **Monorepo:** the Elixir server lives in `ricqchet-web/`, the TypeScript client in `ricqchet-ts-client/`. Run every `mix` command and resolve relative source paths from inside `ricqchet-web/`. For TypeScript-client changes, run the `npm` checks (`build`, `test`, `lint`, `format:check`) from `ricqchet-ts-client/` instead of `mix precommit`.

## Steps

1. **Check for uncommitted changes** — Ensure the working tree is clean:
   - Run `git status` to check for uncommitted changes
   - If there are uncommitted changes, warn the user and stop — do not stash or discard work

2. **Fetch and rebase** — Update the branch:
   - Run `git fetch origin main`
   - Run `git rebase origin/main`
   - If the rebase completes cleanly, skip to step 4

3. **Resolve conflicts** — For each conflicting file:
   - Run `git diff` to see the conflict markers
   - Read the conflicting file to understand both sides of the conflict
   - Resolve the conflict by preserving the intent from both branches
   - Run `git add <file>` to mark as resolved
   - Run `git rebase --continue` to proceed
   - Repeat until all conflicts are resolved
   - If a conflict is ambiguous or risky, stop and ask the user for guidance

4. **Verify** — Ensure the rebase didn't break anything:
   - Run `mix precommit` (compile --warnings-as-errors, deps.unlock --unused, format, credo --strict, dialyzer, test)
   - If any step fails, investigate and fix the issue

5. **Report** — Summarize what happened:
   - How many commits were rebased
   - Whether any conflicts were resolved (and what they were)
   - Whether all checks pass
